Peace Out is a classic horror indie game with a simple but polular concept. 
Your interaction key is E. The game begins once you pick up the scroll on the starting desk.
Collect all 20 scrolls and leave before the monster gets you. The scrolls are hidden in various spots around the castle and once you find them, return to where you spawned and leave through the door. Remember, the game gets progressively harder as you collect scrolls. 
Have fun!
